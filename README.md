# BalanceSensor-VisualFeedback

This code was made to visualize update in accelerometer value from MPU6050 sensor in realtime using firebase. The deployed version of the code can be seen as a site here : https://prototype-perancangan.web.app/

Reuse of code is possible by reconfiguring the firebase config on /src/index.js
